Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, affecting millions of lives each year. Timely and accurate
diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In the search for more precise
diagnostic tools, machine learning has emerged as a promising route. For these reasons, we decided to look into a
data set that has real implications when applying the techniques learned throughout this course. In this project, we
are looking to use the methods listed below to train a model to accurately classify whether a breast cancer tumor
will be malignant or benign. The following models will be trained using the data:
 - Logistic Regression
 – Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
 – Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
 – Bagging (special case of Random Forest)
 – Random Forest
 – K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
 – Naive Bayes
 – Decision Tress
 – Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   – Linear Kernel
   – Polynomial kernel
   – Radial kernel
The best model will be selected based on the accuracy with which it was able to classify the tumors. We will also
use cross validation as our way to validate the accuracy of the model rather than splitting the data into a test and
train set. This will also help fine tune the model which is important when there are many predictors and when
understanding the bias variance trade off is key. The specific models were chosen as to not redo work that has
already been done. Upon doing research into past data analyses performed, these four models had not yet been
trained using this data set. Once we are done, the performance of the models we chose can be compared to the
other classification methods that have been used in other studies.
